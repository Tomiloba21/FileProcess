Question 1?
I spent a total of 5hrs on this project

Question 2?
I made sure to implement to an interface , this was done in the service
package, the class implemented the service method,to encourage loose coupling
and for unit testing, more importantly, incase of an update in the service

Question 3?
If I had more time , I would create a service that downloads the file instead of returning the formatted file

Question 4? 
In honesty, It was a decent task , and it made me more confident of my core java skills and springboot configuration
